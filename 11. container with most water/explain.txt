1. Finding the maximum area formed by two vertical lines and the x-axis 
Area = min(height[i], height[j]) x (j - i)
Water height is limited by the shorter line
width is the distance between the lines

2. Two pointer approach
Left = 0, right = len(height) - 1

Logic: 
1. Calculate current area using the shorter line as height
2. Move the pointer with the shorter height inward
3. Track the maxium area
